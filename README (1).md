# 🛒 E-commerce Recommendation System

This project implements a **Product Recommendation System** for e-commerce platforms using **Python** and **Machine Learning**.  
It predicts user preferences and recommends relevant products, helping businesses improve engagement and conversions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
In online shopping, users face **information overload** while browsing through thousands of products.  
A recommendation system helps by:
- Suggesting personalized products to users
- Improving user experience
- Boosting sales & customer retention

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🤖 Machine Learning based recommendation
- 🎯 Personalized product suggestions
- 📝 Easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook implementation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – ML algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used contains product details and user interactions.  
It includes:
- Product ID  
- Category  
- Ratings  
- User purchase history  


---

## 📖 Code Walkthrough

### 1. Importing Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
```

### 2. Loading the Dataset
```python
data = pd.read_csv("products.csv")
data.head()
```

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Normalizing product features  

### 4. Building Recommendation Engine
- **Content-based filtering** using product similarity  
- **Collaborative filtering** using user-product interactions  

### 5. Generating Recommendations
```python
def recommend(product_name):
    # Finds similar products using cosine similarity
    ...
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ecommerce-Recommendation-System.git
cd Ecommerce-Recommendation-System
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Product_Recommendation_System.ipynb
```

4. Run all cells to see recommendations in action.

## 📊 Example Output
If a user views **"Wireless Earbuds"**, the system might recommend:  
- "Bluetooth Headphones"  
- "Portable Speaker"  
- "Smartwatch"  

---

## 💡 Use Cases
- E-commerce platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra)  
- Online streaming services (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube)  
- News & Content personalization  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)** for better accuracy  
- Use **API-based product fetching** instead of static dataset  
- Integrate into a **Flask/Django web app**  
- Include **real-time recommendations**
